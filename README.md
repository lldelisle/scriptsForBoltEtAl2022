# scriptsForBoltEtAl2022

All scripts necessary to build figures from raw data in Bolt et al. 2022.

Some analyses rely on a conda environment. To create it use:

```bash
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
```

`genomes` contains the commandlines to build the full mutant genome used in the other NGS analyses.

Each of these directories contain command lines for the corresponding analyses: `ATAC`, `cHi-C`, `ChIP`, `CUTandRUN`.

`HOX13_motifs` contains both a bash script and results from motif analysis using HOMER.

`nCATS` contains both sbatch scripts and additional scripts (R, bash) needed to reproduce the analysis as well as results in the `outputs` folder. This include the pdf used for Figure 2S.

`annotations` contains bed files with known annotations or position of motifs.

`plots` contains a bash script with all commands to generate configuration files and output files of all figures generated by [pyGenomeTracks](https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks).
